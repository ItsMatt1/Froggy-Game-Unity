This is my second game i have made in my journey. Its very simple i've only made it in order to improve my programming and sound design skills.

The song i made with a friend: https://soundcloud.com/itssmatt/momentum

Some assets i created using aseprite, but the majority was used from Pixel Adventure 1 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360
